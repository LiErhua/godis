# godis

godis - a [Redis](http://redis.io) client for Go. It supports all
commands and features such as transactions and pubsub.

1. [Package docs](http://simonklee.org/pkg/godis/)
2. [Source code](https://github.com/simonz05/godis)

## Install godis

godis is available at github.com. Get it by running.

    $ git clone git://github.com/simonz05/godis.git

And now compile and install it with one command.

    $ make install

Importing godis to your code can be done with `import "godis"`. Thats it!

## Use godis

Checking out the code include a few examples. Here is the code for
the `example/strings.go`.

    package main

    import (
        "godis"
        "fmt"
    )

    func main() {
        // new client on default port 6379, select db 0 and use no password
        c := godis.New("tcp:127.0.0.1:6379", 0, "") 

        // set the key "foo" to "Hello Redis"
        c.Set("foo", "Hello Redis")

        // retrieve the value of "foo". Returns an Elem obj
        elem, _ := c.Get("foo")

        // convert the obj to a string and print it 
        fmt.Println("foo: ", elem.String())
    }

Build the examples. 

    $ make 

To run it we type.

    $ ./string
    foo: Hello Redis

In case your redis server isn't running the output looks like this.

    $ ./string 
    Connection error 127.0.0.1:6379

## Transactions

Pipelines include support for MULTI/EXEC operations.

    c := godis.NewPipeClient("tcp:127.0.0.1:6379", 0, "")

Create a PipeClient. Subsequent commands will be buffered. PipeClient
acts as a regular client, but implements a few extra commands;
`Multi`, `Exec`, `Unwatch`, `Watch`.

    c.Multi()

Calling Multi() wraps subsequent commands inside MULTI .. EXEC.

    c.Set("foo", "bar")
    c.Get("foo")

Commands are still issued as usual, but will return an empty Reply.

    replies := c.Exec()

To execute the buffered commands we call c.Exec(). Exec handles both
MULTI/EXEC pipelines and simply buffered piplines. It returns a slice
of all the *Reply objects for every command we executed.

See `example/transaction.go` for a full example.

## TODO

  * Add tests server commands.

## Acknowledgment

The work on this client started as I was hacking around on Michael Hoisie's
original redis client for Go. Also the recent work done by Frank MÃ¼ller on his
client gave me some pointers how to better handle return values.
