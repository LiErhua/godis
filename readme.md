# godis

godis - a [Redis](http://redis.io) client for Go. It supports all Redis commands
and common features such as pipelines and pubsub.

1. [Readme](http://susr.org/godis/)
2. [Package docs](http://susr.org/godis/pkg/)
3. [Source code](https://github.com/simonz05/godis)

## Install godis

It is available at github.com, simply run:

    $ git clone git://github.com/simonz05/godis.git

And now compile and install it with one command: 

    $ make install

Importing godis to your code is now done with `import "godis"`. Thats it!

## Use godis

Running git clone also checks out some examples into the `examples` directory.
Here is a simple string SET/GET code.

    package main

    import (
        "godis"
        "fmt"
    )

    func main() {
        // new client on default port 6379, select db 0 and use no password
        c := godis.New("", 0, "") 

        // set the key "foo" to "Hello Redis"
        c.Set("foo", "Hello Redis")

        // retrieve the value of "foo". Returns an Elem obj
        elem, _ := c.Get("foo")

        // convert the obj to a string and print it 
        fmt.Println("foo: ", elem.String())
    }

Build it: 

    $ make 

To run it we only need to type:

    $ ./string
    foo: Hello Redis

In case your redis server isn't running the output looks like this.

    $ ./string 
    Connection error 127.0.0.1:6379

## TODO

  * Add tests for sorted set and server commands.
  * Implement transactions.
  * Pipeline need more testing.
  * Multi.
  * Add support for unix socket.

## Acknowledgment

The work on this client started as I was hacking around on Michael Hoisie's
original redis client for Go. Also the recent work done by Frank MÃ¼ller on his
client gave me some pointers how to better handle return values.
