# godis

godis - a [Redis](http://redis.io) client for Go. It supports all Redis commands
and common features such as pipelines and pubsub.

1. [Readme](http://susr.org/godis/)
2. [Package docs](http://susr.org/godis/pkg/)
3. [Source code](https://github.com/simonz05/godis)

## Install godis

godis is available at github.com. Get it by running.

    $ git clone git://github.com/simonz05/godis.git

And now compile and install it with one command.

    $ make install

Importing godis to your code can be done with `import "godis"`. Thats it!

## Use godis

Running git clone also checks out some examples into the `examples` directory.
Here is the code for the SET/GET example.

    package main

    import (
        "godis"
        "fmt"
    )

    func main() {
        // new client on default port 6379, select db 0 and use no password
        c := godis.New("tcp:127.0.0.1:6379", 0, "") 

        // set the key "foo" to "Hello Redis"
        c.Set("foo", "Hello Redis")

        // retrieve the value of "foo". Returns an Elem obj
        elem, _ := c.Get("foo")

        // convert the obj to a string and print it 
        fmt.Println("foo: ", elem.String())
    }

Build the examples. 

    $ make 

To run it we type.

    $ ./string
    foo: Hello Redis

In case your redis server isn't running the output looks like this.

    $ ./string 
    Connection error 127.0.0.1:6379

## Transactions

Pipelines include support for MULTI/EXEC operations.

    c := godis.New("tcp:127.0.0.1:6379", 0, "")

Mark a client as a pipeline with c.Pipeline. Subsequent commands will
be buffered.

    p := c.Pipeline(true)

`Pipe struct` is returned. It implements `Multi`, `Exec`, `Unwatch`*,
`Watch`*, `Discard`*. The latter three are still not implemented.
Passing `true` to the Pipeline will mark this as a transaction.

    c.Set("foo", "bar")
    c.Get("foo")

Commands are still called as usual on the Client object.

    replies := p.Exec()

To execute the buffered commands we call p.Exec(). Exec handles both
MULTI/EXEC pipelines and simply buffered piplines. It return a slice
of all the *Reply objects for every command we executed.

## TODO

  * Add tests server commands.
  * Implement transactions.
  * Pipeline need more testing.

## Acknowledgment

The work on this client started as I was hacking around on Michael Hoisie's
original redis client for Go. Also the recent work done by Frank MÃ¼ller on his
client gave me some pointers how to better handle return values.
