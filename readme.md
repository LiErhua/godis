A simple Redis client for Go.

## todo

*. Write documentation and add some examples.

* Add all tests for sorted set and some server stuff.

*. PipeClient logic is not safe at all. If an error occurs and the user
continues to call ReadReply after that, a new connection will be poped and we
will try to continue reading, making the client hang/timeout ... repeat.

## acknowledgment

The work on this client started as I was hacking around on Michael Hoisie's
original redis client for Go. Also the recent work done by Frank MÃ¼ller on his
client gave me some pointers how to better handle return values.
