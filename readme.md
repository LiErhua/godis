# godis

godis - a [Redis](http://redis.io) client for Go.

## Description

The godis package implements a client for Redis. It supports all redis
commands and common features such as pipelines and pubsub.

## Install

Use either goinstall or git and make to install the pkg.

### goinstall

[goinstall](http://golang.org/cmd/goinstall/) download and install the
client with one command.

    $ goinstall github.com/simonz05/godis

goinstall puts godis in the $GOROOT/src/pkg/github.com/simonz05
directory. You can now import godis with `import
"github.com/simonz05/godis" 

### git

[godis source code](https://github.com/simonz05/godis) is available at
github.com and can be checked out with git.

    $ git clone git://github.com/simonz05/godis.git

To compile we only need to run make in the godis directory.

    $ make install

You can now import godis with `import "godis"`.

## Examples

To get and run the examples use the git install method explained in
the section above.

    package main

    import (
        "godis"
        "fmt"
    )

    func main() {
        // new client on default port 6379, select db 0 and use no password
        c := godis.New("", 0, "") 

        // set the key "foo" to "Hello Redis"
        c.Set("foo", "Hello Redis")

        // retrieve the value of "foo". Returns an Elem obj
        elem, _ := c.Get("foo")

        // convert the obj to a string and print it 
        fmt.Println("foo: ", elem.String())
    }

To test this example go to the example/ directory.

    $ cd example/
    $ make string

By running make we got an executable called `string`.

    $ ./string
    foo: Hello Redis

If your redis-server isn't running the output looks like this.

    $ ./string 
    Connection error 127.0.0.1:6379

## Docs

This readme file as well as all the [package
docs](http://susr.org/godis/pkg/) for all the commands is available at
is available on [susr.org/godis](http://susr.org/godis/)

## todo

    * Write documentation and add some examples.

    * Add all tests for sorted set and some server stuff.

    * Implement transactions.

    * Pipeline need more testing.

## acknowledgment

The work on this client started as I was hacking around on Michael Hoisie's
original redis client for Go. Also the recent work done by Frank MÃ¼ller on his
client gave me some pointers how to better handle return values.
