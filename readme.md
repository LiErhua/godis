# godis

A simple client for [Redis](http://redis.io).

* Commands API exactly mimics the Redis commands. It is extremly consistent with
  the real deal.
* Flexible design to with the goal of bringing support for pipelining to the client.

## Install

Simply use goinstall to get the client and dependencies.

    $ goinstall github.com/simonz05/godis

### Example

    package main

    import (
        "github.com/simonz05/godis"
        "fmt"
    )

    func main() {
        // new client on default IP/port, redis db to 0 and no password
        c := godis.New("127.0.0.1:6379", 0, "") 

        // set a "foo" to "bar" 
        godis.Set(c, "foo", "bar")

        // retrieve the value of "foo"
        foo, _ := godis.Get(c, "foo")

        // convert return value back to string and print it
        fmt.Println("foo: ", foo.String())
    }

## todo

* Write documentation and add some examples.

* Add all tests for sorted set and some server stuff.

* Implement pub-sub and transactions.

* PipeClient logic is not safe at all. If an error occurs and the user
continues to call ReadReply after that, a new connection will be poped and we
will try to continue reading, making the client hang/timeout ... repeat.

## acknowledgment

The work on this client started as I was hacking around on Michael Hoisie's
original redis client for Go. Also the recent work done by Frank MÃ¼ller on his
client gave me some pointers how to better handle return values.
